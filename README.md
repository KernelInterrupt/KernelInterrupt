## About me  
  I am an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. My research interests encompass edge computing, on-device AI, computer vision, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, I am dedicated to developing intuitive and user-friendly machine learning systems.  
  I am deeply passionate about open-source software and firmly believe in its transformative power, which has continually shaped the world and will undoubtedly continue to do so in the future.

## Side Projects:
### [Playboy](https://github.com/Playboy-Player/playboy):
A cross-platform player enhanced by Machine Learning and Large Language Models(LLMs).

### [PyTorch-Dart](https://github.com/Playboy-Player/pytorch_dart):  
In my freshman year, I embarked on learning Flutter and quickly saw the potential of integrating it with machine learning to create innovative applications. However, I found the preprocessing and post-processing tasks to be particularly cumbersome, often requiring extensive efforts to manage nested lists and inefficiently handle tensor operations. To address these challenges, I developed PyTorch_Dart. This project provides users with a PyTorch-like experience and delivers superior performance compared to other plugins that rely on method channels or Dart native.
